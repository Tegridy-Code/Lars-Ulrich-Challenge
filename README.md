#### The Lakh MIDI Dataset is distributed with a CC-BY 4.0 license; if you use this data in any capacity, please reference this page and my thesis:

#### Of course, I did not transcribe any of the MIDI files in the Lakh MIDI Dataset. While MIDI files have a built-in mechanism for attribution (the Copyright meta-event), it is not used consistently, so attributing each of the MIDI files in the dataset to a particular author is not feasible.
